     <p>Dear User</p>
     <p>We would like to alert you about an issue with your recent orders. The distance between the destinations of the two orders you have combined exceeds 120 kilometers.</p>
     
     <p>To ensure efficient and timely delivery, we advise you to refrain from combining orders with such a significant distance difference. This can lead to complications, including delays and higher shipping costs.</p>
     
     <p>Please review the details below:</p>
     
     <table>
       <tr>
         <th>Dispatch No</th>
        <th>Order Numbers</th>
        
         <th>Total Weight</th>
        
         <th>Dispatch Plant</th>
         
         <th>Customer</th>
         
         <th>Destinations</th>
       </tr>
     </table>
     
     <p>For a seamless experience, we recommend placing separate orders for each destination.</p>
     
     <p>If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to contact our customer support team.</p>
     
     <p>Thank you for your cooperation.</p>
